    "\n",
    "To support semantic search and Q&A on consumer complaints, we developed a RAG pipeline that combines dense retrieval with answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Retrieval\n",
    "We used the FAISS vector store built in Task 2. A query is embedded using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, normalized, and searched against the vector store to retrieve top-k similar complaint chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each retrieved chunk includes metadata: `Complaint ID`, `product`, and `chunk_index`, allowing us to trace results to source complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Answer Generation\n",
    "We implemented two generation modes:\n",
    "- **Rule-based:** Extracts frequent product categories and issue patterns (e.g., \"unauthorized\", \"fees\").\n",
    "- **LLM-based (optional):** Uses `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` via Hugging Face pipeline to generate natural language answers using the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ RAG Pipeline Usage\n",
    "The `SimpleRAGPipeline` class supports:\n",
    "- `retrieve()`: Embeds query and fetches relevant chunks\n",
    "- `generate_answer()`: Generates an answer based on mode\n",
    "- `query()`: End-to-end RAG pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Outcome\n",
    "The RAG system can now:\n",
    "- Answer custom queries like \"What are common savings account issues?\"\n",
    "- Retrieve relevant excerpts with metadata\n",
    "- Generate clear, traceable answers either with rules or LLM\n"
