# CrediTrust Complaint-Answering Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enable semantic search and question-answering on consumer complaints related to financial products such as Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), Savings Accounts, and Money Transfers.

## Summary of Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded and filtered 9.6 million consumer complaints down to 459,138 relevant complaints.
- Analyzed product distribution, narrative quality, and missing data patterns.
- Identified BNPL-related complaints via narrative keyword search due to absence of direct labels.

### Task 2: Vector Store Creation and Testing
- Built a FAISS vector store with 820,653 text chunks from the filtered complaints.
- Generated metadata linking chunks to complaint IDs and products.
- Tested retrieval accuracy using example queries, noting limited BNPL-specific results.

### Task 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
- Developed a RAG system combining dense retrieval (FAISS) with rule-based or LLM-based answer generation.
- Integrated the `SimpleRAGPipeline` class with methods for retrieval, answer generation, and end-to-end querying.
- Evaluated RAG pipeline with multiple domain-relevant questions; results saved in `rag_evaluation_results.csv`.


### Task 4: Interactive Chat Interface
- Built a user-friendly web interface using Gradio.
- Features text input, submit button, generated answer display, and source text excerpts for transparency.
- Supports easy question entry and response visualization.
